## Introduction

In this project, I build a home lab for active directory. Using PowerShell, I generated users to get user account name and passwords for hundreds of people. 

## Virtual Machines used During the Project.

So in this project I used a Domain Controller(DC) VM and an regular Client VM to make sure DHCP is configured and working properly on the DC VM.
